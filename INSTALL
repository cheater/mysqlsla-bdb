Installing mysqlsla
===================

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

Depending on your system, the mysqlsla script will be copied to some common bin
directory (/usr/local/bin/ for example). Then you should be able to run it from
the command line like: mysqlsla -lt slow LOG

For quick help, man mysqlsla
