mysqlsla version 2.03
=====================
mysqlsla parses, filters, analyzes and sorts MySQL slow, general, binary
and microslow patched slow logs in order to create a customizable report
of the queries and their meta-property values.

Since these reports are customizable, they can be used for human consumption
or be fed into other scripts to further analyze the queries.

For example, to profile with mk-query-profiler (a script from Baron Schwartz's
Maatkit) every unique SELECT statement using database foo from a slow log:

   mysqlsla -lt slow slow.log -R print-unique -mf "db=foo" -sf "+SELECT" | \
   mk-query-profiler -separate -database foo

In brief, mysqlsla is a liaison allowing other scripts easy access to queries
from a MySQL log.
